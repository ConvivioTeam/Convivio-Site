title: Working from home with Convivio
---

We are a fully distributed company. We don’t have a central office. We encourage flexible working. We call this [free-range working.](https://blog.weareconvivio.com/free-range-working-an-introduction-27eb178db97c)

We all work primarily from home, and if you work with us you’d be expected to do the same. There are many benefits to this way of working, and there are also many considerations. We’re always working to mitigate the considerations, so we can all enjoy the benefits.

You don’t have to spend all your time working from home. We often work from cafes, co-working spaces, and client offices. Sometimes even the beach.

## Benefits

### Flexibility

We have core working hours, but we encourage you to flex your time to fit in with the rest of your life and commitments. For example, Joe has to deliver and collect his children from school, so he flexes his time to fit that in.

### A personalised working environment

You can construct your work environment to fit your individual needs. You can choose your own equipment, layout, lighting, and temperature. You’ll never have to ask someone else to turn the air conditioning down :)

### Improved productivity

There can be fewer distractions, interruptions, and noise at home than in an office environment. You also don’t have to commute, so you’ll have more energy. You can work at the times you find to be the most productive for you. You should be able to find greater concentration and focus.

### Improved work-life balance

The time you save not commuting can be used for much nicer things. Exercise, food preparation, or meditation, for example. Make the most of this time!

You can also use flexible working hours to better arrange the competing responsibilities of your life.

## Considerations

### Responsibility over your working hours

When you work in an office, it’s easy to draw a line between work and non-work life. At home it’s a bit harder than that. You will have to learn to be vigilant against over-working and your own productivity. No one else can see you working, and sometimes that can be difficult!  

### Some travel required

Depending on your role, you will need to travel occasionally for client meetings, workshops, and company get-togethers. We’ve found that getting together is an important part of free-range work, as it boosts communication and trust. Getting a good balance is important. 

### Visibility and communication

You will need to be clear about when you’re working, when you’re not working, and what you’re doing. We hold daily stand-up calls even when we’re not working on client projects. We encourage working out loud in chat. Don’t be afraid to jump on a call for a complicated discussion. We also use tools like [Miro](https://miro.com/) for online collaboration.

### Isolation

When compared to working in an office surrounded by people, working from home can feel quite lonely. This is something you need to be mindful of, different people struggle with this to different degrees. We all try and find ways to replace that human contact, for example: co-working spaces, running clubs, and meet-ups. Also, pets are great.

### Responsibility over your own workspace, equipment, and resources

“With great power comes great responsibility” is a commonly [misattributed quote](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Ben#%22With_great_power_comes_great_responsibility%22) to Uncle Ben. With that out of the way, you’ll need to be able to assess your own workspace and take action to improve it. You can use our [home office assessment](https://cookbook.weareconvivio.com/business-operation-recipe/your-home-working-environment) to help with this.

### Stress

Flexible hours and no commute can help reduce stress, but whether working from home reduces stress depends on your individual circumstances. For example, you might have a busy household, which makes working from home without distraction difficult. To help with this, we try and encourage working from cafes and co-working spaces every now and then. These are all expensable.

## Is working from home suitable for you?

Working from home is not for everyone, even if it seems like a really good idea. We have found that people who work from home need to have attributes to cope with working on their own and with less supervision.

Ideally you will need to be:
* Happy to spend periods of time on your own
* Self-disciplined and self-motivated
* A resilient person who doesn't let setbacks get them down
* Capable of working without supervision
* Capable of separating work from home life
