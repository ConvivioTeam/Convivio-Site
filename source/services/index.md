    <h2 class="site-heading">Discovery</h2>

    <p class="intro-copy">We explore opportunities for digital service provision through user research, digging into organisational needs, market analysis and competitor review, stakeholder engagement and more. </p>

    <p class="intro-copy">The output is a clear definition of the digital service, with identified risks to address, suggested budgets and timescales, and an expectation of the value to be generated.</p>

    <h2 class="site-heading">Prototyping</h2>

    <p class="intro-copy">We work as one team with you and your colleagues to develop rough and cheap prototypes of complex, risky or novel parts of the proposed service in order to test ideas, reduce risk and find the best path to take.</p>

    <p class="intro-copy">We test these ideas with the target users of the service. This is where the learning happens, and by going through this stage the final result is likely to deliver much higher value at much lower risk.</p>

    <h2 class="site-heading">Delivery</h2>

    <p class="intro-copy">We work as one team with you to provide a multi-disciplinary team of designers, developers and delivery specialists who can work in rapid iterations to deliver your digital service. </p>

    <p class="intro-copy">We work in an open and collaborative way, changes and feedback are welcomed as improvements rather than resisted as interference. This ensures we deliver the best possible outcome.</p>
