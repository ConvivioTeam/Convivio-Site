    <h2 class="site-heading">Strategy</h2>

    <p class="intro-copy">We research and evaluate the opportunities and environment to develop a clear digital strategy, for existing digital services or new ones to explore.</p>

    <p class="intro-copy">We assess the level of digital and delivery skills, tools and processes in your organisation and provide training and coaching to develop them — ensuring that your teams are ready to deliver successful digital services.</p>

    <h2 class="site-heading">Discovery</h2>

    <p class="intro-copy">We explore opportunities for digital service provision through user research, digging into organisational needs, market analysis and competitor review, stakeholder engagement and more. </p>

    <p class="intro-copy">The output is a clear definition of the digital service, with identified risks to address, suggested budgets and timescales, and an expectation of the value to be generated.</p>

    <h2 class="site-heading">Prototyping</h2>

    <p class="intro-copy">We work as one team with you and your colleagues to develop rough and cheap prototypes of complex, risky or novel parts of the proposed service in order to test ideas, reduce risk and find the best path to take.</p>

    <p class="intro-copy">We test these ideas with the target users of the service. This is where the learning happens, and by going through this stage the delivery phase is likely to deliver higher value at lower risk.</p>

    <h2 class="site-heading">Delivery</h2>

    <p class="intro-copy">We work as one team with you to provide a multi-disciplinary team of designers, developers and delivery specialists who can work in rapid iterations to deliver your digital service. </p>

    <p class="intro-copy">We work in an open and collaborative way, within a solid delivery process, embracing new learning and change as way to deliver the best outcome.</p>

    <h2 class="site-heading">What happens after delivery?</h2>

    <p class="intro-copy">Once your service is live, that's not the end of the journey — it's a living thing that needs nurturing, monitoring and improving. As well as supporting the live service, we put in place a process of continuous delivery with improvements based on data, user research and more. </p>
