{% include team-profile.html slug="steve-hunton" name="Steve Hunton" title="Project Delivery" location="Newcastle" bio="<p>Project delivery is where you’ll find me. I’m a big fan of a well-delivered project, but I’m interested in bad delivery too.</p>

<p>What I’ve learned from 20 years of different project methodologies and frameworks, on different projects, in different industries, is that so many organisations make project delivery difficult. They’re set up to fail.</p>

<p>A great project is one that delivers what’s important, isn’t distracted by unwieldy processes, gives the team room to explore, melds into the client’s team, and is open and transparent.</p>

<p>My job is to keep delivery simple and let the team focus on delivering what’s important. I like to continually tweak our lean processes. I make time to regularly review what we do, how we do it and whether or not it’s working for us and our clients. </p>

<p>When I’m not knee deep in projects I’ll be playing with power tools in the garage, off camping with the family, or dreaming of building my own cafe racer.</p>" %}
