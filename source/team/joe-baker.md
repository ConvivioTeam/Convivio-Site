{% include team-profile.html slug="joe-baker" name="Joe Baker" title="Tech Lead" location="Birmingham" bio="<p>Tech projects are about people doing good things with technology for people. I care deeply about helping capable people to work well together on successful, healthy, good tech projects that make the world a better place.</p>

<p>As a tech lead, I give attention to the human aspects of leading technical teams and delivering good products for customers. It’s always a thrill to deliver the best technical solution to a practical problem, supporting a technical team and working closely with the customer to achieve it.</p>

<p>I’m old enough to have worked with websites since the late 1990s, before the infamous dotcom bubble. These technical projects range from the small scale to the very large, for little startups and big multinationals, in public, private and non-profit sectors. Originally I was a physics teacher and many of the skills I learnt there have been invaluable.</p>

<p>The arts and humanities are very precious to me. I’ve spent the past nine years working on a PhD in religious studies. I read omnivorously, have a similarly eclectic taste in music, and adore cycling – both riding and watching the professionals. I’m married, and we have four amazing daughters who are growing up fast.</p>" %}
