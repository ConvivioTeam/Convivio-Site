{% include team-profile.html slug="steve-parks" name="Steve Parks" title="Digital Business Strategy" location="London" bio="<p>I enjoy helping client organisations dig into what they do, finding the hard but valuable problems to solve, thinking them through, and then leading teams to successful delivery.</p>

<p>In doing this work, I give training and coaching to help the organisation’s team become ready for the project, and consult with them to understand the problems they need solving. I’m Convivio CEO, too, so I understand business needs, and what it’s like for the people who have to steer organisations.</p>

<p>I’ve worked with websites since 2004. Before that I was a journalist, working for BBC Radio 4 and 5-Live. Alongside more serious interviews, I got to learn to be a rally driver and practise storming buildings with armed police.</p>

<p>Journalism taught me about communicating and asking the tough questions that dig up the important issues – traits I bring to my digital work.</p>

<p>Outside work, I write. I’ve had four books about entrepreneurship published by Pearson and I’m working on my first novel.</p>

<p>I love to cook, especially when there’s a challenge involved – when friends say they’ve got ‘nothing in’, lack of time, or a theme (the last one was gin!).</p>

<p>My enjoyment of food also extends to drinking. I’m a fan of good whisky, wine and beer, and try to taste new ones as well as enjoy old favourites. I live in London but like to get out to the countryside or the water as often as possible.
