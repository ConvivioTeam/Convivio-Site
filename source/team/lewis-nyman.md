{% include team-profile.html slug="lewis-nyman" name="Lewis Nyman" title="UX & Design" location="Brighton" bio="<p>I think everything on the web should be designed with someone in mind. I make sure that Someone is the right person, and that they’re heard and understood – and I try and put a smile on their face 😄</p>

<p>I help organisations come up with great ideas using fun ways of thinking and working together. I help them figure out how they can help their users, design great experiences, and deliver their awesome ideas into the real world.</p>

<p>I’ve been working with the web since 2007 and I’ve worked with organisations such as The Judicial Appointments Commission, Kew Gardens, Royal Mail, and Comic Relief. I have a qualifying law degree, but I also used to be a stilt walker, so I’m not that bad!</p>

<p>I care about happiness, openness, spreading knowledge, and healthy bodies and minds. </p>
