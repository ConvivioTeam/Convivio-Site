<h2 class="sub-heading">Our ambition is to do good for a million people by helping organisations to make measurable improvements to serving them online as citizens, customers, users and staff.</h2>

To do this, we have three points of focus:

1. Developing, using and sharing a solid professional process with better ways to work.
2. Helping forward-thinking proactive changemakers in large organisations deliver positive transformation in the way their organisation works and serves their audiences using digital technology.
3. Building healthy, long-term partnerships with clients and partners.

Our ways of working are governed by our strong values:

1. Healthy: putting people first, looking after ourselves and others, looking long-term, working sustainably. Working with integrity, being honest and frank, being ethical, earning trust. Doing the right thing.
2. Professional: developing talent and tools, asking great questions, having high standards and ensuring quality. Achieving excellence. Doing things right.
3. Ambitious: Growing ourselves, our knowledge and our expertise. Constantly seeking to be better. Aiming higher. Thinking long term. Change the world. Doing things big.
4. Delivering: Focus and momentum. Meeting the expectations of others. Getting things done done.
5. Sharing: extreme transparency, amazing communication, brilliant collaboration, being open with our work, being consultative, and spreading success. Doing things together.
