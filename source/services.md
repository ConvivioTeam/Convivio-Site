<h2 class="sub-heading">Strategy and readiness</h2>

<p>We help you research and evaluate the opportunities and environment to develop a clear digital strategy, including proposals for digital services to explore.
Also, we help assess the level of digital and delivery skills, tools and processes in your organisation and provide training and coaching to develop them — ensuring that you are ready to deliver successful digital services.</p>

<h2 class="sub-heading">Service Prototyping</h2>

<p>We work as one team with you and your colleagues to develop rough and cheap prototypes of complex, risky or novel parts of the proposed service in order to test ideas, reduce risk and find the best path to take. The ideas are tested with the target users of the service. This is where the core learning happens, and by going through this stage the result is likely to deliver much higher value at much lower risk.</p>

<h2 class="sub-heading">Service Delivery</h2>

<p>We work as one team with you to provide a multi-disciplinary team of designers, developers and delivery specialists who can work in rapid iterations to deliver your digital service. The work is done in a very open and collaborative way, in which changes are welcomed as improvements rather than resisted as interference. This ensures we deliver the best possible outcome.</p>

</ul>

<h2 class="sub-heading">Service Management</h2>

<p>Once your service is live we monitor its status, and work with your teams and 3rd party hosting providers to ensure a high quality of service, as well as continuous learning and development. This ensures the service is treated as a living thing that evolves and improves, as well as simply staying on.</p>

<p>All of our work is aligned with the UK Government Digital Services Service Design standard, which has now also been adopted by the US and Australian governments. Our services are available in the UK government’s Digital Marketplace or on the BBC’s digital services framework.</p>
