title: Join the Convivio team
---
There’ll soon be more seats around Convivio’s big table. It’s been a busy summer already and we’re planning to expand our team.

We prefer building relationships to the traditional ‘CV out of the blue’ approach — so we’d like to start hearing from people now who’d be interested in joining us in the coming months.

If you’re looking for a new challenge in digital, then Convivio could be the perfect next move for your career.

## What are we like?

We’re an enthusiastic, collaborative and friendly team who are quickly building a great agency to help our customers solve some big problems.

We focus on designing and building digital services — helping large public and private sector organisations move their core processes online.

We work in very open ways, and often together with other partner agencies, or clients’ in-house teams.

We work in a distributed way, so you can be based anywhere (for now, within the EU), but you must be willing to travel regularly to London for key meetings and events.

You can explore our blog to find out a bit more about who we are and what we’re up to.

## Who are we looking for?

We’re seeking front-end and back-end developers but not just any old developers.

The technical stack stuff isn’t as important to us as your people skills and way of thinking.

We want good communicators who enjoy solving problems, exploring ideas, discovering new ways to work, working with real people, and working on projects that make a difference.

You’ll like drawing on the walls, sticking up post-its, coaching and supporting others, eating great food, and continuously improving yourself, others, and how we do what we do.

We’d like to hear from both people we’ve worked with before and fresh faces we haven’t met yet.

Interested? Send an email to introduce yourself, explain where you’d like to fit into our team, and how you’d make a difference to <a href="mailto:steve.hunton@weareconvivio.com">steve.hunton@weareconvivio.com</a>. Then let’s chat!
